# N+1 Query Detector for JPA (Hibernate)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
To use the N+1 Query Detector, ensure that your project meets the following requirements.

- **Spring Boot:** 3.0.0 or higher
- **Java:** 17 or higher
- **Hibernate:** 6.x (compatible with Spring Boot 3.x)

## üì¶ Dependence
To integrate the N+1 Query Detector into your project, follow the steps below depending on your build tool.

#### Gradle (build.gradle)

```
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {  
    implementation 'com.github.joon6093:jpa-nplus1-detector:2.1.0'  
}
```

#### Maven (pom.xml)

```
<repositories>  
    <repository>  
        <id>jitpack.io</id>  
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>  
    </repository>  
</repositories>

<dependency>  
    <groupId>com.github.joon6093</groupId>  
    <artifactId>jpa-nplus1-detector</artifactId>  
    <version>2.1.0</version>  
</dependency>
```

## üîß Configuration
To enable the N+1 query detector, update your Spring Boot configuration file.

#### YAML (application.yml)
```
spring:
  jpa:  
    properties:  
      hibernate:  
        detector:  
          enabled: true     # Enable N+1 query detection (default: false)  
          threshold: 2      # Set the threshold for query execution count (default: 2)
          level: warn       # Set the log level for detected N+1 issues (default: warn)
```

#### Properties (application.properties)
```
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.detector.enabled=true     # Enable N+1 query detection (default: false)
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.detector.threshold=2      # Set the threshold for query execution count (default: 2)
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.detector.level=warn       # Set the log level for detected N+1 issues (default: warn)
```

## üìÑ Log
When the N+1 Detector is enabled, a startup log shows the activation status, threshold, and log level.
```
2024-08-27T14:59:54.307+09:00 INFO --- i.j.detector.config.NPlusOneDetectorLoggingConfig : N+1 Detector enabled in 'LOGGING' mode. Monitoring queries with a threshold of '2' and logging at 'warn' level.
```

Example log when an N+1 issue is detected.
```
2024-08-19T13:04:22.645+09:00 WARN --- i.j.detector.template.NPlusOneQueryLogger : N+1 issue detected: 'select b1_0.author_id,b1_0.id,b1_0.title from book b1_0 where b1_0.author_id=?' was executed 2 times.
```

## üîç Test
The N+1 Query Detector can be used in test code with two modes, in combination with @SpringBootTest or @DataJpaTest, and any test-specific settings will take precedence over global configuration.

### Logging mode
In Logging mode, the N+1 detector logs detected issues for you to review without interrupting the test flow.
```
@NPlusOneTest(mode = NPlusOneTest.Mode.LOGGING, threshold = 3, level = Level.DEBUG) 
```

If an N+1 issue is detected during test execution, it will be logged as follows.
```
2024-09-20T12:18:19.828+09:00 WARN --- i.j.detector.template.NPlusOneQueryLogger : N+1 issue detected: 'select o1_0.id,o1_0.order_number from "order" o1_0 where o1_0.id=?' was executed 3 times.
```

### Exception mode
In Exception mode, the N+1 detector throws an exception whenever an N+1 issue is detected, enforcing stricter query checks during tests.
```
@NPlusOneTest(mode = NPlusOneTest.Mode.EXCEPTION, threshold = 5)
```

If an N+1 issue is detected during test execution, an exception is thrown. When multiple N+1 exceptions occur within the same test, they are consolidated into a single exception, with additional exceptions being suppressed and thrown together.
```
io.jeyong.detector.exception.NPlusOneQueryException: N+1 issue detected: 'select o1_0.id,o1_0.order_number from "order" o1_0 where o1_0.id=?' was executed 3 times.
Suppressed: io.jeyong.detector.exception.NPlusOneQueryException: N+1 issue detected: 'select a1_0.id,a1_0.city,a1_0.street from address a1_0 where a1_0.id=?' was executed 3 times.
Suppressed: io.jeyong.detector.exception.NPlusOneQueryException: N+1 issue detected: 'select p1_0.id,p1_0.address_id,p1_0.name from person p1_0 where p1_0.address_id=?' was executed 3 times.
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Note
- Please be aware that the N+1 query detector is disabled by default (enabled: false) due to potential performance implications. It is recommended to enable this feature only in your local or development environment to avoid any negative impact on production performance.
- If you encounter any types of N+1 issues that the detector does not catch, please report them by creating an issue in the project repository. This will help us improve the tool by updating and enhancing its detection capabilities.
- If you found this project helpful or interesting, please consider giving it a star on GitHub! ‚≠ê
